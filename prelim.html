          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <p>
            How are we able to use the hostname instead of IP address in SSH
            commands?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            We are able to achieve the use of using the IP address in SSH
            commands by performing the 4 in task 4 which we are editing the
            /etc/hosts file where we add the IP address of server1 and server2
            corresponding to its name. In this way we are stating an alias to an
            IP address where we can use it in accessing the SSH servers using
            only the username of the server.
          </p>
          <p>How secured is SSH?</p>
          <p>
            SSH uses the TCP protocol in port 22 in connecting to the remote
            machine but this connection is not secured by default. The SSH does
            is it first encrypts the packets that are being sent in the receiver
            machine then decrypts it after accepting the packet and vice versa.
            The other reason why SSH is connected is because it uses a multiplex
            multiple connect which creates a tunnel over the TCP connection. It
            also uses authentication when connecting to a machine that provides
            a high level of security but it can be brute forced sometimes.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>To sum up, this activity aims to introduce and perform ssh authentication using key pairs. The first task is where I created a ssh key pair using the “ssh-keygen” command and specifying the bits and encryption method. The second task is where we are copying the public key to the remote server to allow remote access without entering the machine’s password. Lastly, the task three where I perform the creation of Github account and repository. Also, I perform the cloning and pushing in the cloud git repository. Overall, this activity gives me confidence in performing SSH commands and executing git commands in cloning and pushing to a remote repository.</p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>What do you think we should look for in choosing the best distribution between Debian and Red Hat Linux distributions?</p>
          <p>We should look into choosing the best distribution between Debian and RedHat because one of these distributions will suit your needs. It also depends on your preference between their different package managers.</p>
          <p>What are the main difference between Debian and Red Hat Linux distributions?</p>
          <p>The main difference between Debian and RedHat is the package manager. Debian uses ‘apt’ and ‘dpkg’ while RedHat uses ‘dnf’ and ‘yum’. Also, it is different when it comes to open sources usage because Debian offers free long term support for a server operating system while the RedHat offers free long term support like CentOS and also supports a paid server.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>To sum up this activity, the first part is focused on performing elevated and ad hoc commands using ansible. It uses the “–become –ask-become-pass” to elevate the privilege in performing commands in remote servers like initiating an installation of vim as I performed in task one. The task one provides the verification in the two servers, if there is a change in the system the actions are provided in the file of /etc/apt/library.log. On the other hand, task two introduces me to the yml configuration of ansible playbook. This file is a series of actions that executes when it is called by the ansible software. Also, it includes the use of reading the “PLAY RECAP” to determine if there are any changes to the remote servers.</p>

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <p>Why do you think refactoring of playbook codes is important?</p>
          <p>In doing refactoring, we are simplifying the massive yml configuration file into smaller and flexible code that can handle a bunch of commands that are suited for different operating systems without specifying it. As I observe in the task it performs the refactoring in a phase which shows on how we can simplify our yml ansible code into smaller version of it plus a feature of flexibility by defining a variable. Where the variable is stated in the yml file while the values are stated in the inventory file under ansible directory.</p>
          <p>When do we use the “when” command in playbook? </p>
          <p>The “when” command is a basic conditional command for ansible yml configuration files. This is used when we are integrating a condition to a process like the “when: ansible_distributtion = osperating_system”. If this command is inside of a block of  process then it will first check whether the operating system matches the server before running the command. Therefore, this command is used in a wide variety of different yml configurations but mostly used in defining an operating system.</p>
